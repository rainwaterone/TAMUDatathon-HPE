# COVID-19 Impact on K-12 Students 

All around the world, K-12 students are adapting to the changes put in place by COVID-19. Schools are now conducted online, meaning that 
students are increasingly reliant on the resources available at home. Students at a significant disadvantage include those from low-income 
housholds, without access to home internet, with parents suffering from job instability, and in single-parent homes. 
HPE is committed to making a positive impact on the community and knows firsthand the advantage technology can provide.
This data visualization tool uses a dataset from the Urban Institute to compare the percentages of students in each state living in poverty, without internet access, in homes
with job instability, and living with a single parent. Each of these targeted communities needs extra support during the pandemic, and HPE
has the resources to make a difference.

## Why Students Matter to HPE 

HPE knows that K-12 students are the next generation of engineers, programmers, creators, and scholars that will impact the world. 
That's why it's important to invest in these future community members and ensure their success. 

## Vulnerable Demographics 

This app identifies four populations that are especially vulnerable due to COVID-19: 

- __Students living in poverty__ typically rely on school breakfast and lunch to receive their meals. Now that the students are forced
	to stay home, they may not always have enough food. 
	
- **Students without access to internet or a computer** cannot complete assignments or attend class online. These students will fall 
	behind in school. 
- **Students in homes with unstable jobs** have parents or guardians with a job hindered by COVID-19. Reasons for job vulnerability
	include inability to transition to remote work, business closures, and lay-offs. 
- **Students in single-parent homes** now require a parent, guardian, sibling, or babysitter to stay home with them. Single parents
	might have difficulty staying home with their child if they cannot work from home.
