Students at a significant disadvantage include those from low-income housholds, without access to home internet, with parents suffering from job instability, and in single-parent homes. HPE is committed to making a positive impact on the community and knows firsthand the advantage technology can provide. This data visualization tool uses a dataset from the Urban Institute to compare the percentages of students in each state living in poverty, without internet access, in homes with job instability, and living with a single parent. Each of these targeted communities needs extra support during the pandemic, and HPE has the resources to make a difference.")

- __Students living in poverty__ typically rely on school breakfast and lunch to receive their meals. Now that the students are forced to stay home, they may not always have enough food. 
	
- **Students without access to internet or a computer** cannot complete assignments or attend class online. These students will fall 
	behind in school. 
- **Students in homes with unstable jobs** have parents or guardians with a job hindered by COVID-19. Reasons for job vulnerability
	include inability to transition to remote work, business closures, and lay-offs. 
- **Students in single-parent homes** now require a parent, guardian, sibling, or babysitter to stay home with them. Single parents
	might have difficulty staying home with their child if they cannot work from home.
